    One or multiple pages.
    Be as creative and expressive as you'd like - this is an exercise.
    No word count; no need to summarize the exhibit (we were there!).
    Possible/optional topics: general thoughts about the power of design to transform social behaviors and permeate our daily lives? which objects stood out? what objects will be added to this selection in the future?
    Bonus if your website experiments with responsiveness: do colors change? does type change size? do things appear or disappear? is there animation? how might your design communicate different feelings or meanings when it adapts?
    Responsive examples (resize the browser): Jacob Hoving, Cow That, In a Week, Caterpillar, Tea Party

                    The United Nations estimates that there are 281 million migrants around the world--a number that will only increase as people contrinue to be displaced by conflict, political and economic instability, and climate change. This flag aims to bring people together in support of refugees. Refugee Nation is a nonprofit that was born on the occasion of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro to allow refugee athletes to compete as one people. Yara Said based her design of the flag "on my own experience of crossing the sea from Turkey to Greece in a life vest." "Black and orange is a symbol of solidarity with all these brave souls that had to wear life vests to cross the sea to look for safety in a new country," she stated.

                    Some symbols can move the whole world. The Rainbow Flag, first unfurled at the San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Freedom Day Parade on June 25, 1978, is a gleaming example. Led by Baker, a political activist and designer, thirty volunteers hand-dyed and stitched rainbow flags for the event. Baker, who called the rainbow a "natural flag in the sky," was inspired by the proliferation of the US flag in popular culture as a symbol of commemoration, power, and festivity. MoMA first displayed the contemporary, mass-produced version of the flag on June 26, 2015, the day the US Supreme Court made the historic decision to legalize same-sex marriage. The rainbow flag continues to symbolize pride, acceptance, community, diversity, and, above all, love.

                    Ambrosz took an action as old as humankind and turned it into design. The form of this cup is based on the instrinctive act of drinking from a natural water source with your bare hands, cupping them to act as a vessel. The cup is best held with both hands, cradling the rounded base using the indentations on the sides. Because the vessel is transparent, it becomes almost invisible, creating the illusion of enjoying water directly from your cupped palms.

                    Engineers and designers have worked for decades on efficient alternatives to the traditional QWERTY keyboard and other standard keyboards in various alphabets. Tagtype is a ten-button device for Japanesse characters that was initially developed by a disabled novelist, Ransel Eto, and is today offered as a DIY kit. Its design was based on the gojuon, a five-by-ten grid that shows the combinations of vowels and consonants that form the syllables of the Japanese phonetic alphabets (hiragana and katakana). By replicating the gojuon's logical structure in a compact and ergonomic layout, Tagtype makes typing in Japanese easier and more intuitive.

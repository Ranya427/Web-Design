            <h2>Mr. and Mrs. Fox are now living in a hole with their 12 (fox) year old son. Mr. Fox tells Mrs. Fox that he doesn't like feeling poor, so he buys an expensive tree for them to live in. The tree is on top of a hill that overlooks three farmers, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, all mean and greedy and stocked with goods.</h2>

            <h2>Mr. and Mrs. Fox steal animals from farmers together to feed themselves. One day, they get caught by a foxtrap, caused by Mr. Fox's desire to show off his intellect. While they're both in the middle of the cage, Mrs. Fox reveals that she's pregnant. She asserts that Mr. Fox needs to find a new, safer line of work to support the family, and he hesitantly agrees.</h2>
